# Football-Match-Simulation-Preview
Preview of my Football Match Simulation program. Message me for access to the project: affank1020@gmail.com

Written in C#
- Includes a total of 98 teams from Europe's top 5 leagues: English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, Italian Serie A, French Ligue 1 and German Bundesliga
- Features over 3000 top division football players
- Select any team, pick lineups and view detailed results on scorelines, individual performances and overall match statistics
- Includes in-depth summary of results over 1000 simulations of the matchup, for complete analysis
- Statistics on players and teams are updated as of 28.2.23

The program requires an SQL database to store information on players, teams and leagues. Calculations for the simulation are based on a range of player and team statistics, and are carried out using Poisson distribution and other complex probability models.

The YouTube video below showcases the program running.
